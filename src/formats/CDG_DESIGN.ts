/**
 * CDG (Compact Disc + Graphics) Format - Design Document
 *
 * WHAT IS CDG?
 * ============
 * CDG is a binary format used by karaoke machines to display synchronized lyrics
 * and graphics alongside audio. It was created in the 1980s for CD+G discs.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * - 24-byte packets (subchannel data, 300 packets per second)
 * - 300x216 pixel display (12x18 tiles of 6x12 pixels each)
 * - 16-color palette (limited but sufficient for text)
 * - Simple command set: clear screen, draw tiles, set palette, etc.
 *
 * KARAOKE DISPLAY BEHAVIOR - The Art of Anticipation
 * ===================================================
 *
 * From observing professional karaoke systems, here's the storytelling pattern:
 *
 * 1. INTRO PHASE (0-10 seconds)
 *    - Display song title (centered, large font)
 *    - Display artist name (smaller, below title)
 *    - Optional: Album art or decorative border
 *    - This gives singers time to prepare
 *
 * 2. PRE-SINGING DISPLAY (Traditional Look-Ahead)
 *    - Professional systems often show upcoming line 2-4 seconds ahead
 *    - Display in "inactive" color (usually white/gray)
 *    - Gives singer time to read and prepare
 *    - Note: We're NOT doing this - see our implementation decisions below
 *
 * 3. ACTIVE SINGING (Highlight Phase)
 *    - Change text color to "active" (usually yellow/bright)
 *    - TWO COMMON HIGHLIGHT STRATEGIES:
 *      a) Word-by-word: Entire word changes color when it starts
 *      b) Character-by-character: Smooth "wipe" effect using syllable timing
 *    - Our rich syllable data enables the smooth wipe effect!
 *    - Some systems use bouncing balls or other effects (can be distracting)
 *
 * 4. TIMING PRECISION
 *    - Highlight MUST sync with audio precisely
 *    - Account for syllable boundaries (not just word boundaries)
 *    - Brief pause between lines (typically 100-200ms)
 *
 * 5. SCREEN LAYOUT STRATEGIES (Traditional)
 *    - Single line: Large text, easy to read, classic karaoke
 *    - Two lines: Current line + preview of next line
 *    - Scrolling: Lines move up as new ones appear (can be hard to read)
 *    - Centered vs aligned: Centered is traditional
 *
 * 6. COLOR PSYCHOLOGY (Traditional)
 *    - Background: Black or dark blue (high contrast)
 *    - Inactive text: White or light gray (readable but subdued)
 *    - Active text: Yellow or bright cyan (eye-catching)
 *    - Shadow/outline: Some systems add black outline (debatable value)
 *
 * OUR IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS
 * ============================
 *
 * Based on our rich syllable timing data and design preferences:
 *
 * 1. SINGLE-LINE DISPLAY
 *    - Show ONLY the currently singing line at a time
 *    - No look-ahead or preview of next line
 *    - No inactive/preview color - line appears only when singing begins
 *    - Line appears when first word starts
 *    - Line persists in active color until last word's endTime
 *
 * 2. SMOOTH SYLLABLE-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTING
 *    - Use our syllable timing to create character-accurate "wipe" effect
 *    - Each syllable changes color precisely when sung (left-to-right)
 *    - Characters stay active color (yellow) once lit
 *    - Entire line remains active color until the line's last word endTime
 *    - Smoother and more precise than traditional word-level highlighting
 *
 * 3. INTELLIGENT LINE BREAKING (When Needed)
 *    - Use timing metadata and punctuation for natural breaks
 *    - Let the data guide decisions - pauses, breath marks, etc.
 *    - Break at word boundaries primarily
 *    - Keep it simple and natural - avoid "too much information"
 *    - IMPORTANT: NO font size changes for lyrics (consistency is key)
 *
 * 4. SMART VERTICAL POSITIONING
 *    - Default position: Natural center-ish location (~40% down from top)
 *    - Architecture supports multiple vertical positions
 *    - During transitions, use alternate positions to avoid overlap
 *    - This enables pixel-level "fade" effect between lines
 *    - Primarily use default position
 *    - Occasionally (randomly) use alternate positions for visual variety
 *
 * 5. LINE TRANSITIONS (The "Fade" Effect)
 *    - Between lines: If time is available, do pixel-level transition
 *    - Old line pixels gradually update to become new line pixels
 *    - Simulates fade effect (we lack true transparency/alpha blending)
 *    - New line appears at different vertical position (not on top of old)
 *    - If insufficient time between lines: Direct cut to new line
 *    - Worth experimenting with when time permits
 *
 * 6. TEXT PRESENTATION
 *    - Horizontal alignment: Centered (classic karaoke)
 *    - Font: Fixed size throughout lyrics (no distracting size changes)
 *    - Characters stay active color until line's last word ends
 *    - No shadows or outlines - clean, simple presentation
 *    - Color: Bright yellow for active text on black background
 *
 * 7. INTRO/OUTRO SCREENS
 *    - First 5 seconds: Title + Author/Artist
 *    - Last 5 seconds: Title + "Thank you!" (if time allows)
 *    - Different font rules may apply here (not lyrics)
 *
 * TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
 * ====================
 *
 * 1. Tile-Based Graphics
 *    - CDG uses 6x12 pixel tiles, not arbitrary pixels
 *    - Text must be rendered to tiles first
 *    - Font design is limited by tile resolution
 *    - Creative opportunity: Characters don't need to align perfectly to tiles
 *
 * 2. 16-Color Palette Limitation
 *    - Must choose colors wisely
 *    - Typical palette: black, white, yellow, gray shades, blue
 *    - No gradients or anti-aliasing available
 *    - Our simpler design needs fewer colors (advantage!)
 *
 * 3. Timing Precision
 *    - 300 packets/second = ~3.33ms per packet
 *    - Must convert our millisecond timing to packet indices
 *    - Small jitter is acceptable (humans won't notice <50ms)
 *    - Our syllable data provides precise timing information
 *
 * 4. File Size Considerations
 *    - Naive approach: Redraw entire screen = huge files
 *    - Smart approach: Only update changed tiles
 *    - Pre-calculate all text positions to optimize
 *    - Note: We prioritize quality over file size/speed
 *      (rendering is offline, not real-time, so we can take our time)
 *

 *
 * DATA FLOW
 * =========
 *
 * Input: Our KaraokeProject data
 *   - Lyrics with syllable timing (milliseconds)
 *   - Word boundaries and syllable breakdowns
 *   - Metadata (title, artist/author, captions)
 *
 * Process:
 *   1. Calculate packet timing (ms → packet index at 300 packets/sec)
 *   2. Layout text on screen (positioning, multi-position support)
 *   3. Render text to tiles (character → 6x12 pixel tiles)
 *   4. Generate intro/outro screens
 *   5. Generate color change commands (syllable timing)
 *   6. Create transition effects between lines
 *   7. Optimize (only send changed tiles when beneficial)
 *
 * Output: Binary CDG file
 *   - Stream of 24-byte packets
 *   - Must be synchronized with audio
 *   - Plays at the project's file baseline (300 packets/second)
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
 * =====================================
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT: Much of what we're doing is PRESENTATION, not encoding!
 *
 * CDG is just ONE way to encode the presentation. By separating concerns,
 * we can support multiple output formats and enable testing/preview.
 *
 * SEPARATION STRATEGY:
 *
 * 1. PRESENTATION LAYER (Format-Agnostic)
 *    - KaraokePresentationEngine class
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      * Calculate what text appears when
 *      * Determine character positions on screen
 *      * Map syllable timing to character highlighting
 *      * Handle vertical positioning and transitions
 *      * Apply line breaking logic
 *      * Generate intro/outro screens
 *    - Output: High-level presentation commands (abstract)
 *      * "Show text 'Hello' at position (100, 80) at time 1500ms"
 *      * "Change character 0-4 to active color at time 1500ms"
 *      * "Transition from position A to position B over 300ms"
 *
 * 2. ENCODING LAYER (Format-Specific)
 *    - CDGWriter class - Converts presentation to CDG binary packets
 *    - TerminalRenderer class - Converts presentation to ANSI terminal output
 *    - PowerShellRenderer class - Converts presentation to PowerShell/Windows console
 *    - HTMLRenderer class - (Future) Converts to web-based preview
 *    - Each encoder handles its format's specifics:
 *      * CDG: Tile-based graphics, 16-color palette, 300 packets/sec
 *      * Terminal: ANSI escape codes, UTF-8 text, cursor positioning
 *      * PowerShell: Console API, colored text
 *
 * 3. SHARED UTILITIES
 *    - TextLayoutEngine: Calculate text positioning and wrapping
 *    - TimingConverter: Convert milliseconds to format-specific timing units
 *    - FontRenderer: Abstract font rendering (tiles for CDG, chars for terminal)
 *    - ColorMapper: Map logical colors (active/inactive) to format palettes
 *
 * BENEFITS:
 * - Test presentation logic without CDG complexity
 * - Preview output on Linux terminal or Windows PowerShell
 * - Validate timing and layout before encoding
 * - Easy to add new output formats (HTML5, SVG, video, etc.)
 * - Each class has single responsibility (easier testing)
 * - Mock karaoke playback for development/debugging
 * - Hunt down actual karaoke machine only for final testing!
 *
 * EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
 *
 *   KaraokeProject → PresentationEngine → [PresentationCommands]
 *                                                ↓

 *                    CDGWriter            TerminalRenderer      PowerShellRenderer
 *                         ↓                      ↓                      ↓
 *                   .cdg file            ANSI terminal          Windows Console
 *                (karaoke machine)        (Linux/Mac)          (PowerShell)
