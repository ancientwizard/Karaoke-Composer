So per/fect it can't be real, yet hope will make it so.
Speak my name with love, and I will know your soul.
Where love can find a voice, two hearts will live as one.

We meet in No/vem/ber, like a song of sto/ries told.
So per/fect it be/came real, where hope has made it so.
You spoke my name with love; you'd always felt it so.
I al/rea/dy fall/ing, my heart knew it was home.

Come meet me this No/vem/ber, to live our life fore/told.
Our Mo/ments yet to hap/pen, al/rea/dy feel like old.

I Choose You! Wal/king hand in hand.
I Choose You! Danc/ing through the night.
I Choose You.

Our time a con/ver/sa/tion, our words a love song.
We sang into each other, where love we grew made strong.
In that per/fect mel/o/dy, our souls had found their home.

You're my Tex/as in No/vem/ber; our life made a new.
So per/fect it be/came truth, where hope has made it so.
I al/rea/dy fall/ing, my heart has come home.

I Choose You! Now and in Nov/em/ber.
I Choose You! Now and in for/ever.
I Choose You!

We started in, A Texas No/vem/ber,
and in that moment, you found your heart a home.

Come meet me in No/vem/ber, to live our life fore/told.
Our mo/ments yet to hap/pen, al/rea/dy feel like old.

You Choose Me! In all No/vem/ber.
You Choose Me! Make it for/e/ver.

(whisper)
I do.`
